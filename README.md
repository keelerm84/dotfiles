# dotfiles #

Everyone has a dotfiles repo, right?  Well this is mine.  It is structured as a
castle for the [homeshick](https://github.com/andsens/homeshick) tool, which
allows easy management for dotfile repos.

## Included Tools ##
This repo contains dotfiles for the tools I use most often

### vim ###
Vim is a great editor.  If you don't know how to use it, then you should
invest the time to learn.

### Emacs ###
Most people learn one editor, and it is the one they love for the rest of their
lives.  But for me, one is not enough.
[Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) is the other of the two giants, and
definitely worth your time to learn.

**NOTE** My emacs configuration is actually stored in another
[repository](https://github.com/keelerm84/.emacs.d).

### tmux ###
A fantastic [terminal multiplexer](http://tmux.sourceforge.net/).  I was an
avid [GNU Screen](http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/) user for a long time,
but I have come to appreciate the awesomeness that is tmux.

### zsh ###
[bash](http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) is fantastic.  There is no denying
it.  But I must say, I have come to love [zsh](http://www.zsh.org/).  It's
quite amazing.
